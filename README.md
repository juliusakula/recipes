# recipes
Markdown is pretty sweet... use it to record recipes, hopefully include images, put meals into folders, those folders have subfolders for each meal item (PorkChop, BrusselsSprouts). The information per-item is in an index.md file in that sub-folder - everything has a "Meal " if not a meal then a category "dessert", and each meal or category has broad info the spreads across the subfolders.

Going to use my recursive markdown parser, so it will be similar to this: http://karma-tech-consulting.github.io/learning-resources/
